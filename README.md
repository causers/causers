A high-performance statistical package for Polars (and pandas) DataFrames, powered by Rust.

## 🚀 Overview

`causers` provides blazing-fast statistical operations for both Polars and pandas DataFrames, leveraging Rust's performance through PyO3 bindings. Designed for data scientists and analysts who need production-grade performance without sacrificing ease of use.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🏎️ High Performance**: Linear regression on 1M rows in ~250ms with HC3 standard errors
- **📊 Multiple Regression**: Support for multiple covariates with matrix-based OLS
- **🔮 Logistic Regression**: Binary outcome regression with Newton-Raphson MLE, fixed effects via Mundlak strategy
- **📈 Robust Standard Errors**: HC3 heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors included
- **🎯 Flexible Models**: Optional intercept for fully saturated models
- **🏢 Clustered Standard Errors**: Cluster-robust SE for panel/grouped data
- **🔄 Bootstrap Methods**: Wild cluster bootstrap (linear) and score bootstrap (logistic)
- **📋 Two-Way Fixed Effects**: Panel data regression with entity and time fixed effects
- **🧪 Synthetic DID**: Synthetic Difference-in-Differences for causal inference with panel data
- **🎯 Synthetic Control**: Classic SC with 4 method variants (traditional, penalized, robust, augmented)
- **🔬 Two-Stage Least Squares (IV)**: Instrumental variables estimation for causal inference with endogeneity
- **🤖 Double Machine Learning**: Debiased/orthogonalized ML for causal inference with cross-fitting
- **🔧 Native Polars Integration**: Zero-copy operations on Polars DataFrames
- **🐼 pandas Support**: Seamlessly pass pandas DataFrames - automatic conversion with minimal overhead
- **🦀 Rust-Powered**: Core computations in Rust for maximum throughput
- **🐍 Pythonic API**: Clean, intuitive interface with full type hints
- **🌍 Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS (Intel/ARM), and Windows
